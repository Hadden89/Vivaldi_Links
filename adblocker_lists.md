NOTES:

* ~~Adding the same list from different sources will break the ruleset.~~
* I don't care about cookies have a slight chance to break pages;
* In most cases Easylist + [your country list](https://easylist.to/pages/other-supplementary-filter-lists-and-easylist-variants.html) is fine;
* Nano Lists [could be questionable](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362) as the addon is officially dead;
* Some lists include others one; don't overboard on blocking;
* Multipurpose and tracker lists are more aggressive so you may need more frequent (manual) whitelisting.
* [Thread](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/45703/share-blocking-sources) with several lists hosted by community users.
